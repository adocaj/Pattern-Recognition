HMM calculation for the CS5341 course. We initally randomly select two users, let's say users 1 and 2. And, then randomly select two sessions of these users, and use this data to train our HMM model. Once the model is trained, we randomly select two sessions different from the ones used in training, from these same users, and employ this data in the testing part of our model. Finally, we randomly select two different users, let's say users 3 and 4, and randomly select a session of each user to test our original HMM model. ROC curves are provided for each case.
